# Data Driven A/B Testing Analysis of Student Behavior

This repository contains the analysis of student behavior using A/B Testing and hypothesis testing with the Chi-Square test to evaluate differences in mobile operator preferences between users from Tamil Nadu and outside Tamil Nadu. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and visualization of the test results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze user preferences regarding mobile operators based on their geographical region (Tamil Nadu vs. Outside Tamil Nadu). This analysis provides actionable insights to help businesses and educational institutions enhance student engagement and improve learning outcomes.

## Features

- **A/B Testing**: Perform hypothesis testing to compare user behavior across different groups (Control vs Test).
- **Chi-Square Test**: Statistical analysis to evaluate differences in mobile operator preferences between users from Tamil Nadu and users outside Tamil Nadu.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning and preprocessing raw user data for analysis.
- **Segmentation**: Grouping users into control and test groups for comparative analysis.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing key metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide a clear view of the test results.
- **Data-Backed Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations derived from statistical results with a 95% confidence level.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **SciPy**: Statistical functions for hypothesis testing, specifically the Chi-Square test.
